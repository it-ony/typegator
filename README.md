The default shortcut to trigger the type navigation is `Ctrl + Shift + F` and on Mac `CMD + Shift + F`.

Start typing and all the links containing the search term will be highlighted. Press `Enter`, 
the `ArrowDown` or `Tab` to select the next candidate and `ArrowUp`, `Shift + Tab` or `Shift + Enter` for
the previous one.

Open the selected link with `CMD + Enter` in the background, in a new window with `Shift + Enter` 
or in the foreground by pressing `CMD + Shift + Enter`.
