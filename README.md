The default shortcut to trigger the type navigation is `Ctrl + Shift + F` and on Mac `CMD + Shift + F`.

the `ArrowDown` or `Tab` to select the next candidate and `ArrowUp`, `Shift + Tab` or `Shift + Enter` for
the previous one.

or in the foreground by pressing `CMD + Shift + Enter`.

## Search

The search knows these types of groups
* l - link
* t - tab

To search in all groups simply type a keyword you like to search for. 
To search in specific group use the abbreviation followed by a `:` and the search term, e.g.
* `l:foo` to only search for links containing foo
* `t:bar` to only search for tabs containing bar
